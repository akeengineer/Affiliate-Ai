# Project State

Affiliate Product Intelligence OS — current system state as of the Phase 3
release freeze.

## 1. Current architecture

- **Local-first CLI workflow.** All operator actions run as local scripts; there
  is no server process.
- **Obsidian-style vault as file-based business memory.** Markdown notes with
  YAML frontmatter under `vault/` are the only backend/project memory.
- **Deterministic Python scripts and bash wrappers.** Scoring, reporting,
  import, and dashboards are deterministic Python; each is fronted by a bash
  wrapper enforcing guardrails.
- **Hermes dry-run governance proofs.** Hermes orchestration is proven via safe
  dry-runs (Phase 2F/2J) that write tmp artifacts only.
- **GitHub branch/PR/squash workflow.** Engineering control plane; feature
  branches, pull requests, and squash merges.
- **No database.** No relational/NoSQL store; files only.
- **No FastAPI.** No web service layer.
- **No UI.** Operator interaction is CLI text only.

## 2. Current operator commands

```
bash scripts/dev/command_center.sh help
bash scripts/dev/command_center.sh status
bash scripts/dev/command_center.sh doctor
bash scripts/dev/command_center.sh dry-run vault/samples/import/product-candidates.csv 2026-W26 prod-laptop-stand
bash scripts/dev/command_center.sh product prod-laptop-stand 2026-W26
bash scripts/dev/command_center.sh portfolio 2026-W26 --top 5 --write
bash scripts/dev/run_phase3d_acceptance.sh
```

The command center (`help`, `status`, `doctor`, `dry-run`, `product`,
`portfolio`) is the single operator entrypoint. The acceptance pack
(`run_phase3d_acceptance.sh`) drives the safe path end to end.

## 3. Artifact map

### tmp outputs

Generated, gitignored working outputs:

- `tmp/phase1-smoke/`
- `tmp/phase2c-warroom/`
- `tmp/phase2d-import/`
- `tmp/phase2e-import-score-report/` (`scores/*.json`, `weekly-report-<week>.md`, products)
- `tmp/phase2f-hermes/`
- `tmp/phase2h-decision-review/`
- `tmp/phase2i-decision-finalization/`
- `tmp/phase2j-hermes-governance/`
- `tmp/phase3a-dashboard/`
- `tmp/phase3b-portfolio-dashboard/`

### vault memory outputs

Gitignored business memory areas (Obsidian vault):

- `vault/products`
- `vault/decisions`
- `vault/trends`
- `vault/marketplace-signals`
- `vault/commissions`
- `vault/meetings`
- `vault/contents`
- `vault/compliance`
- `vault/reports`

These are **gitignored business memory areas**. Writes to `vault/products` and
`vault/decisions` require **explicit manual approval gates** (Phase 2G promote,
Phase 2H decision review, Phase 2I finalization, each guarded by an `APPROVE_*`
flag). The default read-only operator path writes none of them.

### docs

- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` (this file)
- `docs/RELEASE_SNAPSHOT_PHASE3.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md`, `docs/DEMO.md`
- `docs/PHASE2_OPERATING_MANUAL.md`, `docs/PHASE2_GOVERNANCE_FLOW.md`
- `docs/SCORING_SPEC.md`, `docs/WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`, `docs/OBSIDIAN_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`

### scripts

- Deterministic core: `score_product.py`, `generate_weekly_report.py`,
  `import_product_candidates.py`, `dashboard_summary.py`,
  `portfolio_dashboard.py`
- Manual-gated (vault-writing) cores: `promote_product_candidates.py`,
  `create_decision.py`, `finalize_decision.py`
- Wrappers: `run_phase2e_*`, `run_phase2f_*`, `run_phase2g_*`, `run_phase2h_*`,
  `run_phase2i_*`, `run_phase2j_*`, `run_phase2_full_dry_run.sh`,
  `run_phase3a_dashboard_summary.sh`, `run_phase3b_portfolio_dashboard.sh`
- Operator: `command_center.sh`, `run_phase3d_acceptance.sh`,
  `show_release_snapshot.sh`

## 4. Guardrails

- no database
- no FastAPI
- no UI
- no external APIs
- no affiliate content generation
- no autopublish
- no campaign launch
- no vault writes by default

## 5. What the system can do now

- sanitized CSV import
- scoring
- weekly report
- Hermes operational proof
- governance dry-run proof
- manual-gated promote/decision/finalization
- single-product dashboard
- portfolio dashboard
- command center
- acceptance demo pack

## 6. What the system cannot do yet

- no UI
- no API
- no database
- no real marketplace connector
- no content generation
- no autopublish
- no campaign launch
- no automatic approval

## 7. Known limitations

- The scores directory is **not week-partitioned**; all `scores/*.json` are read.
- Phase 3B `--week` is a **label / artifact selector, not a score filter**.
- `status` counts are **snapshots** of the current tmp state.
- The acceptance sample is **tied to `prod-laptop-stand`** (the sample CSV).
- `dry-run` **writes tmp artifacts** (tmp-only; no vault).
- The acceptance **vault diff is count/list based**, not content-hash based.

## 8. Security and compliance posture

- **No secrets committed.** `.env`, keys, tokens, payout data are gitignored.
- **No affiliate links emitted.** Outputs never carry affiliate tracking URLs.
- **Output scrubbers** reject vault paths, affiliate URLs, secrets, and affiliate
  content markers in dashboard/acceptance output.
- **Vault writes are manual-gated** behind explicit `APPROVE_*` flags
  (Phase 2G/2H/2I).
- The **command center does not route to approved Phase 2G/2H/2I workflows**;
  only safe read-only / dry-run paths are reachable from it.

See `docs/SECURITY.md` and `docs/OBSIDIAN_CONTRACT.md` for the full policy.
